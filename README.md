# Job Market Analysis and Consolidation: Interactive Dashboard

In this repo we are conducting job market analysis in the U.S market to gauge possibilities of a career in Business Analytics
## Case Prompt:

You consider a career as a Business Analyst and trying to make sense of the job market. What companies, industries, and geographies would make sense to pursue?
You got hold of the data on open Business Analytics positions in the US. There are already three files collected and you expect to receive more. You want to make a dashboard in a way so it automatically updates upon adding new files. This can be achieved by using a power query to consolidate the data.

Letâ€™s first have a look inside any of the BA_data files. It is practically a collection of info about open positions from a database. There is information about the position, salary estimate, and some characteristics of the employer. Also, there is a file states.xlsx that matches cities to the states so you can conveniently analyze the data by geography.

Ultimately, we will be creating an interactive dashboard that will allow us to visualize different metrics to analyse the job market through various metrics.
